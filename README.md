# My-Portfolio
the objective of this assignment is to create a portfolio using the material we have learned in class, and that is HTML and CSS. We had to use our knowledge of margins, padding, borders, and different font families and sizes. this portfolio includes an image of myself, placeholder images for some applications in the future, and of course, ways to contact me. When clicking on either of the buttons, it should direct you to the correct section.
